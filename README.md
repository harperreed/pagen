# CRM Tool

A dual-purpose CRM tool that works both as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Claude Desktop AND as a standalone CLI for direct terminal use.

## Features

- **Contact Management** - Track people with full interaction history
- **Company Management** - Organize contacts by company with industry tracking
- **Deal Pipeline** - Manage sales from prospecting to closed
- **Relationship Tracking** - Map connections between contacts (colleagues, friends, etc.)
- **Universal Query** - Flexible searching across all entity types

## Installation

### Build from Source

```bash
go build -o crm-mcp
```

## Usage

This tool can be used in two ways:

### 1. MCP Server for Claude Desktop

Configure Claude Desktop to use the MCP server.

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crm": {
      "command": "/path/to/crm-mcp",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then restart Claude Desktop and you'll have access to all 13 CRM tools through natural language.

### 2. CLI for Direct Terminal Use

Use the CLI directly for quick CRM operations:

```bash
# Add a company
crm-mcp add-company --name "Acme Corp" --industry "Software" --domain "acme.com"

# Add a contact
crm-mcp add-contact --name "John Smith" --email "john@acme.com" --company "Acme Corp"

# List contacts
crm-mcp list-contacts

# List contacts at specific company
crm-mcp list-contacts --company "Acme Corp"

# Add a deal
crm-mcp add-deal --title "Enterprise License" --company "Acme Corp" --amount 5000000 --stage "negotiation"

# List deals
crm-mcp list-deals

# List deals in specific stage
crm-mcp list-deals --stage "negotiation"

# List companies

```
